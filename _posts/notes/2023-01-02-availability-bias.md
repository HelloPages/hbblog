The availability bias is a tendency to think that examples that come readily to mind are more representative than they actually are.

This cognitive bias leads us to overestimate the likelihood of events that are more easily recalled, usually because they are more recent, unusual, or emotionally charged.

## Examples

- Overestimating the risk of plane crashes after hearing about one in the news
- Believing a certain disease is more common than it is because a friend was recently diagnosed
- Thinking crime is increasing when it's actually decreasing, due to sensationalist news coverage

## How to counter it

1. Look for statistical evidence rather than relying on anecdotes
2. Consider a wider range of examples before making judgments
3. Be aware of how media exposure affects your perception of frequency
